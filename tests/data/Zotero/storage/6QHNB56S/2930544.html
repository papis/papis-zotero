<section class="abstract"><p>New models of space and innovation have 
suggested that firms, particularly small- and medium-sized enterprises 
(SMEs), can obtain and develop new knowledge by participating in 
conferences. However, there is no systematic empirical evidence thus far
 to support this suggestion. Drawing on interactive models of innovation
 and theory on temporary space, we develop the hypothesis that an SME’s 
conference participation affects its innovative performance. Using a 
dataset for a representative sample of 344 high-technology SMEs from the
 electronics industry over a period of 23 years, we found that 
participation in conferences that vary in terms of scientific discipline
 and location can predict SMEs’ innovative performance. Theoretical and 
practical implications are also discussed.</p></section>                        <div class="article-metadata-panel clearfix"><div class="article-metadata-taxonomies">
